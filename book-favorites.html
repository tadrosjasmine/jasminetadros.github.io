                                  <br>This book has changed my approach to learning math and science. It introduced me to effective new study methods, techniques for improving memory, and ways to break down complex information that I plan to use throughout the school year. The most significant takeaway for me was the concept of diffuse mode. I learned how important it is to step away from intense focus and allow my brain to process difficult problems in the background 
                                  (ex. while doing less complicated tasks), which can often lead to breakthroughs and deeper understanding of complex subjects.

                                    <br>Richard Feynman was a character who approached life and his work with a sense of fun and wonder. His passion for physics was not only contagious, 
                                    but he also made others enjoy working with him, and made it easy for his students to engage with him during lectures. Inspired by Feynman's approach, 
                                    I want to bring a similar level of enthusiasm and curiosity to my own work in engineering. I really enjoyed the short stories in this book, and highly recommend reading it for anyone seeking a sense of inspiration.

                                  <br>This book was deeply inspiring due to its powerful message about mindset and resilience. Goggins' relentless determination and refusal to make excuses throughout the difficult circumstances in his own life have motivated me to adopt a similar approach to my own life. The book reinforces the importance of working hard, pushing through challenges, and staying committed to one's goals. This message resonates with me as I apply these 
                                  principles to my work in engineering, pushing through difficulties and remaining dedicated to my goals even when things become difficult.
